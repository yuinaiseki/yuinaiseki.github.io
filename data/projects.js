Our goal is to preserve both recognizable forms and foldability by combining aesthetic style transfer and geometric constraints. Mathematical principles in origami are driving innovations in deployable systems across robotics, architecture, biomedical devices, and aerospace. By developing an AI tool that interprets natural forms through an origami lens, we hope to assist engineers in designing foldable, compact, and rapidly deployable structures for various real-world applications.",

The goal is to strengthen overall communication, trust, and emotional well-being between relationships.",
