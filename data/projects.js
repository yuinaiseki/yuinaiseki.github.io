        fullDescription: "This Computer Vision project seamlessly and automatically blends images using Poisson Image Blending, a gradient-domain technique for image manipulation. The core approach involves solving the discrete Poisson partial differential equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions to reconstruct an unknown region of interest (ROI) that matches the target gradient.",

        fullDescription: "This project examines the effects of the lack of commitment and its impact on cascading failures within real-world social and economic network systems. Specifically, we investigate how defection and cooperation behaviors in a networked Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG) influence cascading failure behavior, potentially leading to large-scale network collapse.",
